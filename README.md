# TR5 Randomizer

A randomizer for **Tomb Raider Chronicles** (PC) — including a build of the
game engine that runs natively on Windows 11 (D3D9 + XAudio2, no wrappers).
Game data is **not** included — bring your own installation. Everything is
GPLv3.

## What this is

Two programs working together:

- **TR5Randomizer** rolls a new game out of your Chronicles installation:
  items, keys and weapons travel, enemies swap roles and journey between
  levels (up to guests from Tomb Raider III), outfits, music, secrets and,
  on request, the level order. The same seed produces the same game on any
  machine.
- **PCTomb5** is a modified version of [TOMB5](https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB5),
  the decompilation project for the PC engine: Direct3D 9 and XAudio2
  instead of DirectDraw/DirectSound, plus the extensions the randomizer
  needs — and a few extras such as a switchable first-person view.

Both are under the **GNU GPL v3**; the complete source code lives here.

## What you need

Your own installation of **Tomb Raider Chronicles**. Game data is
deliberately **not** part of this project — neither levels nor music,
videos or language files. The game belongs to its rights holders; the
randomizer patches your own files at runtime and backs everything up to
`data\Backup` first.

## Building

- **Engine:** `TOMB5 Code\tomb5.vcxproj` with Visual Studio (Win32, Release).
- **Randomizer:** `TR5Randomizer\build\b1.bat` (command line) and
  `b2.bat` (GUI) — both run relative to the repo; Visual Studio with the
  C++ workload is required.
- **Package:** `Tomb5 Rando vorbereitung\Tools\BuildRelease.ps1` assembles
  the shippable folder including source code and licenses.

## Thanks and origin

- **[TOMB5](https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB5)** by Troye (Trxyebeep),
  ChocolateFan, thatguyfrombb and Raildex — without this decompilation
  there would be nothing here.
- **[trview](https://github.com/chreden/trview)** by chreden — the tool
  every single zone boundary of this randomizer was verified with.
- **[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)** by Omar Cornut (MIT) —
  the interface.
- **stb_vorbis / stb_image** by Sean Barrett (public domain) — HQ music and
  the background image.

What was changed in the engine and why is recorded in
`TOMB5 Code\MODIFICATIONS.md`; the player manual ships with the release
package as `README.txt`.
