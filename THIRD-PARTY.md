# Third-party code in this repository

This project is GPLv3 (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). It builds on other people's
work, and this page says whose, under what terms, and where the full text of
each licence lives in this tree. Nothing here is a summary you should rely on
instead of the licence itself — every entry points at the authoritative text.

## The engine

**TOMB5** — Troye / Trxyebeep and contributors,
<https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB5> — **GPLv3**.
Everything under `TOMB5 Code/TOMB5/` is a modified copy of that decompilation.
What was changed and why is recorded file by file in
[TOMB5 Code/MODIFICATIONS.md](TOMB5%20Code/MODIFICATIONS.md), which is also the
dated notice of modification GPLv3 section 5(a) asks for.
Full text: `TOMB5 Code/LICENSE`.

**tomb3** — Troye / Trxyebeep, <https://github.com/Trxyebeep/tomb3> — **GPLv3**.
The control code of four Tomb Raider III enemies (T-Rex, raptor,
Compsognathus, vulture) was taken over directly rather than rewritten, so that
its origin stays visible. Each of those files names its source in its own
header; the whole arrangement is set out in section 3 of MODIFICATIONS.md.
Same licence as this project, which is what allows the combination.

**TROne** — Todesengel — **GPLv3**.
The HD-at-run-time work (#123) carries code over from TROne, which is the same
licence as this project and is what allows the combination. What was taken so
far, file by file:

| Here | From TROne | What |
|---|---|---|
| `TOMB5 Code/TOMB5/specific/hd/hd_install.cpp` | `host/fs/discovery.cpp` | Steam discovery: the registry lookup, the `libraryfolders.vdf` reader in both of its shapes, the "recognise by content, never by folder name" rule, and the wording of the diagnostics. Only the IV-VI branch was taken. |

That file names Todesengel's copyright in its own header, beside our
modification notice, as GPLv3 section 5(a) asks. More of TROne is expected in
the later stages of that work (the render rules, the mesh-bracket logic, the
Lara composite); each will be entered here as it arrives.

## Libraries compiled into the binaries

| Library | Licence | Full text in this tree |
|---|---|---|
| **Dear ImGui** — ocornut, <https://github.com/ocornut/imgui> | MIT | `TR5Randomizer/external/imgui/LICENSE.txt` |
| **zlib** — Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler | zlib licence | notice at the top of `TOMB5 Code/TOMB5/tomb5/libs/zlib/zlib.h` |
| **stb_vorbis** — Sean Barrett, <https://github.com/nothings/stb> | MIT **or** public domain, your choice | notice at the end of `TOMB5 Code/TOMB5/tomb5/libs/stb/stb_vorbis.c` |
| **stb_image** — Sean Barrett, <https://github.com/nothings/stb> | MIT **or** public domain, your choice | notice at the end of `TR5Randomizer/src/libs/stb/stb_image.h` |
| **TRForge** — TRForge contributors | MIT | `TOMB5 Code/TOMB5/vendor/trforge/LICENSE` |

**TRForge** is vendored, not linked against: five files are copied **byte for
byte** into `TOMB5 Code/TOMB5/vendor/trforge/src/` — the reader for the
remasters' `LEVELn.TRG` geometry and the whole-file helpers it needs — and
compiled into `PCTomb5.exe`. `vendor/trforge/VERSION.txt` names the source, the
date, the SHA-256 of every file and what was deliberately **not** taken. The
first three lines of a TRForge module carry a hidden signature, so those files
are never reformatted and never carry our modification notice; anything we need
differently is written in our own wrappers under `TOMB5/specific/hd/`.
`vendor/trforge/NOTICE.md` is the part of TRForge's own notice that applies.

### discord-rpc — shipped in the source tree, not in the binaries

| Library | Licence | Full text in this tree |
|---|---|---|
| **discord-rpc** — Discord, Inc., <https://github.com/discord/discord-rpc> | MIT | `TOMB5 Code/TOMB5/tomb5/libs/discordRPC/LICENSE` |

discord-rpc arrived from upstream TOMB5 as two prebuilt static libraries and
two headers, with no licence file. It is Troye's Discord Rich Presence, and
**this fork switches it off**: `TOMB5 Code/TOMB5/tomb5/tomb5.cpp` opens with
`#define TOMB5_DISCORD_RPC 0`, and every call site sits inside `#if
TOMB5_DISCORD_RPC`. The shipped `PCTomb5.exe` accordingly contains no
occurrence of the string `Discord` at all.

The notice still has to travel, because the two `.lib` files and their headers
are part of the source tree this project distributes — shipping someone's MIT
code without its notice is a violation whether or not a compiler used it. The
licence file above was added for that reason and is the project's own verbatim
copy of the upstream text.

The release package carries all of these in its `Licenses\` folder;
`Preparation/Tools/BuildRelease.ps1` puts them there.

## Credited, but not contained here

trview (chreden), TRmod (b122251), TR Viewer (E. Popov) and Tomb Raider
Chronicles itself are named in the credits because the work would not exist
without them. None of their code is in this repository.

## No game data

No playable Tomb Raider content ships with this project — no levels, no
scripts, no sounds, no music, no videos, no language files, no textures, no
models. The randomizer reads what it needs from the player's own installation
at run time, and the four Tomb Raider III enemies are read from a Tomb Raider
III installation the same way. Without those installations, the affected
features simply do not appear.

Two things are derived from the original levels, and both are worth naming
rather than glossing over.

**In the release: `data\zones_*.json`, 15 files, about 1.2 MB.** Per level a
list of sectors with the floor height and headroom the randomizer needs to
know where an item may legally sit, plus this project's own curation on top
of it — key constraints, fixed items, coupled triggers, which enemy types
belong in that level. The curation is ours; the sector coordinates and
heights are measurements of Core's level design.

**In the repository, not in the release: `Preparation/Level Infos/*.json`,
16 files, about 21 MB.** The fuller survey the zone files are generated
from: rooms, items, triggers and the sector grid, keyed to each `.TRC` by
SHA-256. Until 2026-08-30 a 45 MB copy of these shipped as
`data\level_*.json`; the randomizer now reads what it needs straight from
the level file, so they stayed behind in the repository, where the build
still needs them.

Neither set contains a texture, a mesh, a sound or a script. Neither can be
rendered or played, and neither can reconstruct a level file. They are a
survey of geometry, not a copy of it. But they ARE derived from the game's
level design, so calling this project entirely free of Tomb Raider data
would be overstating it.
