# Modifications to TOMB5

**This is a modified version of TOMB5** (the PC Tomb Raider Chronicles
decompilation project by Troye/Trxyebeep and contributors,
<https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB5>).

Modified between **2026-07-30 and 2026-08-13** for the *TR5 Randomizer* project.
The unmodified upstream code is preserved as the first commit of this
repository (`ebde675`, 2026-07-30), so every change we made is visible as a
diff against it.

Verified on 2026-08-13 against a freshly downloaded copy of the upstream
repository: of the 214 source files we did not touch, 212 are byte-identical
and the remaining two differ only in line endings. The base is therefore
exactly that upstream version, and the 40 files listed below are the whole of
our work.

This modified version remains licensed under the **GNU General Public License
version 3**, the same licence as the original. See `LICENSE`. The complete
corresponding source is distributed alongside any binary we release.
Every file we changed carries a modification notice at the top, as required by
GPLv3 section 5(a).

Original credits are unchanged and remain with the upstream project: Troye
(main programmer, project leader), ChocolateFan, thatguyfrombb, Raildex. The
work below is layered on top of theirs.

## What was changed, and why

The modifications fall into two clearly separable groups. The first would be
useful to anyone who owns Tomb Raider Chronicles and has nothing to do with
randomizing; the second exists only to support the Randomizer.

### 1. Native Windows 11 port (no dgVoodoo2 wrapper)

The original renderer uses DirectDraw 4 and Direct3D 3 immediate mode. On
Windows 11 `IDirect3D3::CreateDevice` fails outright — for the hardware device
*and* for software emulation — so the game cannot create a rendering device at
all without a wrapper. These files were ported to Direct3D 9, following the
approach TR2Main used for Tomb Raider II:

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `specific/dxshell.cpp`, `.h` | Device, surfaces, present, enumeration, cooperative level → D3D9 |
| `specific/output.cpp`, `.h` | Render/present path |
| `specific/function_table.cpp`, `.h` | One-time render state setup |
| `specific/texture.cpp`, `.h` | Texture upload → `CreateTexture`/`LockRect` |
| `specific/drawroom.cpp` | Bump-mapped room rendering |
| `specific/polyinsert.cpp` | `HWR_DrawSortList` submission only; the clip/subdivide maths is untouched |
| `specific/specificfx.cpp`, `drawbars.cpp` | Effects and HUD bars |
| `specific/3dmath.cpp`, `d3dmatrix.cpp` | Transform state constants |
| `specific/LoadSave.cpp`, `.h` | Save thumbnail capture — D3D9 back buffers are not directly lockable |
| `specific/fmv.cpp` | FMV drawn through a D3D9 texture instead of GDI `StretchBlt` |
| `specific/file.cpp` | One stray texture call, plus level-load bounds checks |
| `global/types.h`, `tomb5/pch.h` | The `DXPTR` struct and includes |

Audio was moved from DirectSound to XAudio2 in `specific/dxsound.cpp`; music
streaming in `specific/audio.cpp` was deliberately left on the original path.

Also in this group:

- **Controller support.** `DXUpdateJoystick` was a stub returning zeros despite
  a complete remapping screen already existing in the game. It now polls XInput
  and falls back to DirectInput for controllers that are not XInput devices.
  `specific/input.cpp` gained bindable Pause/Save/Load and medipack slots and a
  fix to `Key()`, which shifted joystick button indices by the wrong amount and
  was therefore dead code.
- **Robustness fixes**, all the same bug class — fixed-size arrays filled from
  level-file counts with no bounds check: the savegame buffer
  (`game/savegame.cpp`, `.h`), the texture page array, `items[]`, spot cameras,
  animating-texture ranges, the sound buffer pool, `BuildOutsideTable`'s stack
  array in `game/setup.cpp`, and the per-frame queue in `game/items.cpp`.
  Upstream TR2's original 1996 code already had a guard in its equivalent of
  `WriteSG`; TR5 either never had one or lost it in decompilation.
- **`D3DCREATE_MULTITHREADED`** in device creation. `LoadTextures` runs on the
  background level-loading thread and calls `CreateTexture`/`LockRect` on the
  same device the main thread is presenting with. That is undefined behaviour
  per the D3D9 documentation and caused intermittent hangs during level loads.
- **Fullscreen** is now borderless windowed. Real exclusive fullscreen never
  recovered from device loss on the test system: `TestCooperativeLevel` stayed
  at `D3DERR_DEVICELOST` forever after alt-tabbing back in.
- **Joystick initialisation moved off the startup path** (`specific/dxshell.cpp`).
  `IDirectInput8::EnumDevices` can take ten seconds when a controller is paired
  over Bluetooth but attached over USB — DirectInput waits for the absent paired
  device. Measured and reproduced in a standalone program, so this is a
  DirectInput timeout rather than a fault in this code, but it left the game on
  a black screen, so the enumeration now runs on its own thread.
- **`Log()` gained millisecond timestamps and an `fflush`** in
  `specific/function_stubs.cpp`. Without the flush the log was routinely empty
  after a crash, which made it useless exactly when it was needed.

### 2. Randomizer-specific changes

- `game/gameflow.cpp` — a Level Select entry in the main menu, reusing the
  level-select screen the game already had behind `PlayAnyLevel`.
- `game/newinv2.cpp`, `game/savegame.cpp` — a TR2-style secret bonus.
- `game/setup.cpp` — one enemy's hit points raised as a balancing decision.
- `game/init.cpp`, `game/items.cpp` — headroom and guards for levels that are
  denser than the originals after randomization.
- `game/control.cpp`, `game/spotcam.cpp` — cutscene and flyby skip via
  controller.
- `tomb5/tomb5.cpp` — **Discord Rich Presence switched off** behind
  `TOMB5_DISCORD_RPC`. The application id in that call belongs to the upstream
  project and is not ours to use, and the bundled `discord-rpc.lib` is built
  against the dynamic C runtime, which prevented linking the executable
  statically. The code is left in place and one `#define` re-enables it.
- `tomb5.vcxproj` — output path, static C runtime (`/MT`) so the executable
  runs without the Visual C++ redistributable, and the Discord library removed.
- `game/laramisc.cpp` — the child-Lara torso swap in `LaraInitialiseMeshes` is
  now tied to `GF_YOUNGLARA` as well as to the level range. Upstream it depended
  on the level name alone, so clearing the flag in `SCRIPT.DAT` to play the
  Ireland levels with the adult Lara left her with the child's chest and a head
  floating above a torso that was too small. With the flag set — that is, with an
  unmodified `SCRIPT.DAT` — nothing changes.

## Building this yourself

You do not need to trust our binary. Either:

- build from this tree directly — open `tomb5.sln`, configuration `Release`,
  platform `x86`; the result is `release/PCtomb5.exe`; or
- start from upstream <https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB5>, and apply our
  changes on top. Every change is a commit in this repository, so
  `git diff ebde675 HEAD -- "TOMB5 Code"` is the complete change set.

Unlike upstream, this build produces a **single self-contained executable**.
Upstream ships `PCTomb5.exe` plus `tomb5.dll`, where the DLL carries the game
code and does its work from `DllMain`; that is why upstream updates can ship as
"dll only". This fork builds the Win32 target as an ordinary application with
its own `WinMain`, so there is no DLL.

**No game data is included, here or in any release we make.** Tomb Raider
Chronicles itself remains the property of its rights holders; you need your own
copy of the game.
