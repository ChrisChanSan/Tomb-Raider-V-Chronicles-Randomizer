	 * The classic path transforms a room-local vertex with the matrix on the
	 * stack and divides by z itself (specific\drawroom.cpp,
	 * aRoomletTransformLight):
	 *
	 *     v  = pos * (view * world)          - a ROW vector, translation in row 3

	 *     sz = f_a - f_boo * (2048 / v.z)
	 *
	 * The HD path hands the device the same matrix times the projection and
	 * lets the hardware divide. If the two disagree by so much as a pixel,
	 * every HD wall stands beside its own floor. So they are compared here,
	 * on the level's own vertices, with the level's own camera - once per
	 * level, into the log, and the numbers are the acceptance of this stage.
	 *
	 * Not a self-test of a formula: the classic side below is the three lines

	 * left it, which is why hd_render splits the bracket into a save and a
	 * restore instead of hiding it inside a room draw. It also means the fog

	 *
	 * AFTER THE ROOMS AND BEFORE DrawBuckets, and here is the whole argument.
	 * The depth buffer is shared and exact (hd_render.cpp, HDRenderSelfTest:
	 * both paths write a - b/z for the same point), so an opaque HD guard and
	 * an opaque classic crate sort themselves out by depth whatever order
	 * they are drawn in - which covers every opaque pixel in the frame and
	 * needs no rule at all. Only the two passes that do NOT write depth care:
	 *
	 *   - A model's ALPHA pass writes depth (it is an alpha test, not a
	 *     blend), so it behaves like the opaque one.
	 *   - A model's ADDITIVE pass does not, and it is drawn before the
	 *     classic buckets. A classic OPAQUE polygon that stands BEHIND such a
	 *     glow and in front of the wall therefore paints over it. Known hole,
	 *     and the same one the rooms have had since stage S1-2; it needs a
	 *     second bracket after DrawBuckets to close and it is worth one only
	 *     if a picture ever shows it. The classic sort list, which is where
	 *     TR5 puts its own see-through polygons, still draws last of all and
	 *     over both.
	 *
	 * Drawing the objects INSIDE the room loop would be worse for a reason
	 * that has nothing to do with depth: a model's state is not a room's, and
	 * swapping shader, declaration and stream twice per room costs more than
	 * the whole object path does. */
