# TR5 Randomizer

A randomizer for **Tomb Raider Chronicles** (PC) — including a build of the
game engine that runs natively on Windows 11 (D3D9 + XAudio2, no wrappers).
Game data is **not** included — bring your own installation. Everything is
GPLv3.

## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Items and keys** | Rolled per level within verified zones — every boundary was checked in trview, so a key never lands where it cannot be reached |
| **Enemies** | Swapped among themselves, or drawn from the whole game; extra enemies on request. Guests from Tomb Raider III (T-Rex, raptor, compy, vulture) come along |
| **Outfits** | Lara's three Chronicles outfits, plus outfits imported from Tomb Raider III — pick what may be rolled in the wardrobe |
| **Secrets** | Placed in a glitchless or a glitched set, or rolled from a pool |
| **Music** | Ambience and triggers permuted; HQ soundtracks in OGG are played if you supply them |
| **Level order** | Optional, from shuffling inside a section up to a free run through the whole game |
| **Difficulty** | Every weapon, enemy and hazard tunable by hand in `Balance.txt`, or by three sliders |
| **Engine** | Native Direct3D 9 and XAudio2, controller support, a first-person view, and a long list of fixed original bugs |

The same **seed** produces the same game on any machine. Seed and build ID
are shown in the pause menu, so a screenshot is enough to reproduce a run.

## What this is

Two programs working together:

- **TR5Randomizer** rolls a new game out of your Chronicles installation:
  items, keys and weapons travel, enemies swap roles and journey between
  levels (up to guests from Tomb Raider III), outfits, music, secrets and,
  on request, the level order. The same seed produces the same game on any
  machine.
- **PCTomb5** is a modified version of [TOMB5](https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB5),
  the decompilation project for the PC engine: Direct3D 9 and XAudio2
  instead of DirectDraw/DirectSound, plus the extensions the randomizer
  needs — and a few extras such as a switchable first-person view.

Both are under the **GNU GPL v3**; the complete source code lives here.

## What you need

Your own installation of **Tomb Raider Chronicles**. Game data is
deliberately **not** part of this project — neither levels nor music,
videos or language files. The game belongs to its rights holders; the
randomizer patches your own files at runtime and backs everything up to
`data\Backup` first.

## Building

- **Engine:** `TOMB5 Code\tomb5.vcxproj` with Visual Studio (Win32, Release).
- **Randomizer:** `TR5Randomizer\build\b1.bat` (command line) and
  `b2.bat` (GUI) — both run relative to the repo; Visual Studio with the
  C++ workload is required.
- **Package:** `Preparation\Tools\BuildRelease.ps1` assembles
  the shippable folder including source code and licenses.

## Thanks and origin

- **[TOMB5](https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB5)** by Troye (Trxyebeep),
  ChocolateFan, thatguyfrombb and Raildex — without this decompilation
  there would be nothing here.
- **[tomb3](https://github.com/Trxyebeep/tomb3)** by Troye (Trxyebeep) and
  contributors — the T-Rex, raptor, compy and vulture control code comes
  from there (GPLv3, taken over directly rather than rewritten, so its
  origin stays visible). Their models and sounds are not shipped; the
  randomizer reads them from your own Tomb Raider III installation.
- **[trview](https://github.com/chreden/trview)** by chreden — the tool
  every single zone boundary of this randomizer was verified with.
- **[Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)** by Omar Cornut (MIT) —
  the interface.
- **stb_vorbis / stb_image** by Sean Barrett (public domain) — HQ music and
  the background image.

**Contributors** — testing, findings and ideas, the people who played the
seeds and reported what broke: XeNoN3560, Lucifer230, Todesengel1931,
Crockett, Grylle, Claude AI.

What was changed in the engine and why is recorded in
`TOMB5 Code\MODIFICATIONS.md`; the player manual ships with the release
package as `README.txt`.
