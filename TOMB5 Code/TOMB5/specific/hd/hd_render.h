 * The structure of the level build (read the .TRG, one buffer for the whole
 * level, a range table per group, three passes per room) and the draw rule
 * are carried over from TROne (Copyright 2026 Todesengel, GPLv3,
 * host\render\game_renderer.cpp, hd_load 1919-2256 and hd_draw_room
 * 2259-2312). The renderer under it is new: TROne is OpenGL 3.3 with vertex
 * arrays, texture arrays and runtime GLSL, this is Direct3D 9 with a vertex
 * declaration, one texture per page and compiled bytecode, beside a
 * fixed-function neighbour that must find its state exactly as it left it.
 * See THIRD-PARTY.md.

// THE HD ROOM RENDERER (#123, stage S1-1).
//
// A second draw path beside the classic one. It shares the back buffer and
// the depth buffer with it and nothing else: its own shaders, its own vertex
// declaration, its own buffers, its own textures. Stage S1-1 builds it and
// proves it with a picture out of RoomProbe; the seam that lets the engine
// call it (draw.cpp, one line) is stage S1-2.
//
// WHY THE DEPTH BUFFER IS SHARED AND NOT FOUGHT OVER. The classic path is
// fixed function with pre-transformed vertices and writes its own depth,
//
//     sz = f_a - f_boo * rhw,  rhw = 2048 / z_view,  f_boo = f_b / 2048
//        = f_a - f_b / z_view
//
// which is exactly what a Direct3D projection matrix produces after the w
// division, with _33 = f_a, _43 = -f_b, _34 = 1, _44 = 0. So an HD room and a
// classic item land on the same depth for the same point in space, and they
// can be drawn in any order, in the same frame, into the same buffer. There
// is no sorting heuristic and no depth bias anywhere in this file - that is
// the whole point, and HDRenderSelfTest() is the proof, run at start-up.
